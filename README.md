# ðŸš€ APIs + Python + LLMs

About This Notebook:
This notebook contains **questions and answers** about APIs, Python, and LLMs.
It also includes some setup steps (Colab, API keys, GitHub), but not all steps are shown â€” some were practiced on my own laptop.

How to Use:
1. Open the notebook (`.ipynb` file) in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Read each question and its answer.
3. Run the code cells (if any) to practice.
4. Use this as a quick reference for APIs, JSON, and Python basics.

ðŸŒŸ Goal
To make API concepts easy through Q\&A format + simple examples
